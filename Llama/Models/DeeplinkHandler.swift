/// Consumes `llama://` URLs and turns them into `ModelManager` downloads.

/// Design notes:
///   - Silent start: the download just begins in the background. User clicks
///     the menu bar icon to see progress. No auto-popup — browser already
///     showed a "Open in Llama?" prompt, so no extra confirmation here
///     either.
///   - No cross-launch persistence: if the app dies mid-download, the
///     `.partial` bytes stay on disk. Re-clicking the same deeplink resolves
///     to the same URLs and `openPartialWriter` resumes from those bytes.
