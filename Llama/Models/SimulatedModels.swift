  /// the row state each one is here to exercise (see the comments). That control
  /// is the point — it deliberately includes states the catalog never expresses
  /// (MTP heads, pending mem profiles, a too-big-to-run build), so each can be
  /// seen rendering. The numbers mirror common real `ggml-org` / `unsloth` GGUF
  /// repos closely enough to look right; they don't need to be exact.
  ///
  /// Enable it on the dev build with:
  ///
  ///   defaults write app.llama.Llama.dev simulateModels -bool YES

  /// and remove it with `defaults delete app.llama.Llama.dev simulateModels`.
  /// When set, `ModelManager.refreshDownloadedModels()` skips the real HF-cache
  /// scan and the mem-profile probes entirely and injects this list instead —
  /// nothing touches `models.ini` or the server, so the simulation is purely a
  /// UI surface. Run/delete actions on these rows won't do anything useful
