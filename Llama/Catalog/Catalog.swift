/// install can get a model running in a couple of clicks without first visiting
/// the website.
///
/// The two picks per family are a smaller, faster-to-download size and the
/// largest size that fits this machine's memory — so a user can try something
/// quickly or go straight for the most capable build their Mac can run. They're
/// shown unlabeled (the model name's param-size and the download size carry the
/// meaning), and collapse to a single row when they resolve to the same build
/// (small Macs, single-size families).
///
/// The full browsing experience stays on the web; the app only ever reads the
